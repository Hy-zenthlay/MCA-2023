<h2>Theme: La Boh√®me, Giacomo Puccini</h2>
<p>I chose this theme for the coursework due to there being a widespread amount of reputable and high quality information, sources and sheet music. Each Week has it's own page bar weeks five and seven, which were combined due to the resulting work being heavily interlinked.</p>
