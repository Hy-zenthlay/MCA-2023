  <h2>Week 10</h2>
  <h3>Task 1</h3>
  <p>Once again, the pieces used for this are Si Mi Chiamano Mimi, Light My Candle, and Don't You Know. These correlate with the track numbers of 1 through 3. The evaluation seems to show the greatest similarty between Si, Mi Chiamano Mimi and Light My Candle, followed by Light my Candle and Don't You Know. Don't You Know and Si Mi Chiamano Mimi seem to have the lowest similarity result.</p>

  <h3>Task 2</h3>
  <b>Original MuseScore Image</b> <br>

  <b>MIDI</b><br><img src="Week10LaBoheme.PolyphonicMIDI.png" alt="Similarity Matrix" style="width:744px; height:1053px;">
  <br><br><br>

  <p>For reasons based in either technology or user error, the wav file that has undergone Polyphonic transcription and then ran back through MuseScore results in a piece of music that is almost unrecognisable from the original. It would not be playable in a way that represents the original music and overall it managed to change from bass to treble cleff, which may be the root of the issue. All od the notes are wrong and all dynamic markings have been lost, as well as fingerings.</p>
