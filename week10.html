  <p>For reasons based in either technology or user error, the wav file that has undergone Polyphonic transcription and then ran back through MuseScore results in a piece of music that is almost unrecognisable from the original. It would not be playable in a way that represents the original music and overall it managed to change from bass to treble cleff, which may be the root of the issue. All od the notes are wrong and all dynamic markings have been lost, as well as fingerings.</p>
