  <h2>Week 9</h2>
  <h3>Task 1</h3>
  <p>For this task, I chose to continue using the music from previous weeks. This is due to already having information about the pieces (those evaluated in week 8) and once again, the different genres may provide clearer contrast and visual differences when using the tools specified in SonicVisualiser. These are an aria from Act 1 of <i>La Boheme</i>, 'Sì, mi chiamano Mimì', a song featuring a similar narrative from <I>Rent</I>, 'Light My Candle', and a song that took great inspiration from the original opera, Della Reese's 'Don't You Know?
