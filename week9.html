  <h2>Week 9</h2>
  <h3>Task 1</h3>
  <p>For this task, I chose to continue using the music from previous weeks. This is due to already having information about the pieces (those evaluated in week 8) and once again, the different genres may provide clearer contrast and visual differences when using the tools specified in SonicVisualiser. These are an aria from Act 1 of <i>La Boheme</i>, 'Sì, mi chiamano Mimì', a song featuring a similar narrative from <I>Rent</I>, 'Light My Candle', and a song that took great inspiration from the original opera, Della Reese's 'Don't You Know?

  <h3>Task 2</h3>
  <p>For this task, I chose to analyse the MFCC feature of my three pieces. <br>

  <b>Si, Mi Chiamano Mimi</b>

  <b>Light My Candle</b>

  <b>Don't You Know?</b>

  Si, Mi Chiamano Mimi's histogram set starts vastly different than the other two pieces. It features a far broader peak due to the scale and like Light My Candle, begins at roughly -20. Don't You Know however seems to begin at around -30. Overall, when looking at the images as a whole, Si Mi Chiamano Mimi has the widest and most consistent histograms, with Light My Candle and Don't You Know having a generally narrower shape to the histogram and also more sporadic layouts. Don't You Know also has the lowest number of high peaks compared to the others, and seems to be the most visually different. This is slightly unexpected as my initial thoughts were that due to Light My Candle and Don't You Know coming from a similar, lower quality source (YouTube) they may have a closer similarity than Mi Chiamano Mimi, which the graphs don't represent. All three songs have very different sounds, but this may be harder to discern using these MFCC graphs.</p>
