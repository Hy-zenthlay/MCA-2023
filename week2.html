    <h2>Week 2</h2>
<h3>Piece identified and edited: Page 43 of the Cello part for <i>La Boheme</i>.</h3>
<br>

<p>While converting the PDF to Musescore, the first issue that occured was frequent issues with files becoming corrupted during the process, so the page transcribed was not the first choice. Even when the file loaded without running into errors, there was still many issues and inconsistencies created by the use of OMR. Most prominenty, Musescore struggled to correctly identify words, specifically tempo markings, dynamics, and fingerings. Most of these had to be manually added and edited to reflect tne original score. It also struggled with certain long rests and slurs, and in general most of the notes had to be modified.

These issues are likely to be related to the quality of the PDF files used, as when previously using the PDF converter in group tasks the clearer and higher quality music pieces had a far higher rate of success compared to the scan of the older sheet music from La Boheme. </p>
